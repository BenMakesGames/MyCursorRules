I've found it quite helpful to build out CLI scripts that the agent can invoke. Then I can reference those tools in the rules.

Naturally, I also use AI to build out these scripts! As with humans, LLMs benefit from helpful error messages, so when building out your CLI tools, ask the AI agent to make "ergonomic" tools to help developers.

Sorry for not sharing *all* the rules for this project, but it is a work project, and some of the rules contain specific details about our codebase that are proprietary.
