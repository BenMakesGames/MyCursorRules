# Rules for Writing Automated Tests

When writing new tests, it is helpful to refer to old tests, but please keep our modern testing standards in mind:

* Do not mock DTOs or other dumb classes (such as Doctrine entities)
* When mocking, use PHP 8 union types to prevent linting errors, for example: `private EntityManagerInterface&MockObject $entityManager;`
* Give tests descriptive names

# Running Tests

```ps
cls; php bin/phpunit <PATH TO TEST FILE>
```

âš  Note:
* Beginning with `cls;` ensures that previous test runs are not mistaken for the current test run.
* It can take up to two minutes for the tests to run! Please wait until you see the full test output before continuing.
