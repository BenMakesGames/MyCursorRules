# Cursor Rules Location

Guidelines for placing and organizing Cursor rule files in the repository.

1. **File Location**
   - ❌ Incorrect locations:
     ```
     rules/my-rule.mdc
     my-rule.mdc
     .rules/my-rule.mdc
     ```
   - ✅ Correct location:
     ```
     .cursor/rules/my-rule.mdc
     ```

2. **Directory Structure**
   ```
   PROJECT_ROOT/
   +-- .cursor/
       +-- rules/
           +-- your-rule-name.mdc
           +-- another-rule.mdc
   ```

3. **File Naming**
   - Use kebab-case for filenames
   - Always use `.mdc` extension
   - Make names descriptive of the rule's purpose
   - Examples:
     ```
     naming-conventions.mdc
     code-style-rules.mdc
     testing-guidelines.mdc
     ```

4. **Never Place Rules**
   - In the project root
   - In subdirectories outside .cursor/rules
   - In any other location
   - Mixed with source code files
