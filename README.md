## What's this?

This is a collection of `.cursor/rules` I happen to have used for one project or another at one time or another. Maybe they're awful for you; maybe they're great for you; maybe they're awful for everyone; maybe they're great for everyone. Who can say - take what you like, and throw the rest in the trash.
